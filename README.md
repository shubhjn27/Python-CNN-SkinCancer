## General Information
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

In order for it to run fine:
  Download the zip file
  Upload the zip file to the Google drive
  The code will try to mount the Gdrive
  Allow the pop-up

## Conclusions
- The accuracy of the model has increased significantly with the use of Augmentor. It solved the issue of class imbalance.
- As it can be seen that there is still some issue related to overfitting.
- The model can be further improved by changing hyper parameters and making adjustments to the model architecture, i.e. number of layers, neurons and dropout layers
